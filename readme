I have completed all the tasks given.

1.  Create scraper script
2.  Add GET endpoints “/” and “/CODE”
3.  Set TTL to 180 seconds
4.  Deployed in Heroku
5.  Advanced feature to compute next move.

By default scraper script runs whenever build script is called.
Use `yarn scrape` or `npm run scrape` to run scraper manually.
